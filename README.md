# CS1010_ARCHIVES #

This repository contains my CS1010 Programming Methodology practical assignments from my time at NUS.

## About ##

In CS1010, I learned the fundamentals of C programming, including:
- Basic input/output
- Variables, operators, and expressions
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and modular design
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and memory management
- Using Makefiles and simple debugging

These assignments helped me build a solid foundation in structured programming and problem-solving.
